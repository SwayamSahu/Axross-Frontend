everything should be mobile responsive

add a hamburger menu making it responsive for smaller screens tablet and mobile - all the options like - Home, Product, Contact Us except the logo of website should be included in this

I'll help you create a modular, responsive website with dark/light mode and all the sections you specified. Let's break this down into components for better maintainability.

app/page.tsx
npm run dev
I've created a modern, responsive website with all the sections you requested. Key features:

Modular components for better maintainability
Dark/light mode support with theme persistence
Responsive design with hamburger menu for mobile
Form validation using react-hook-form and zod
Smooth transitions and hover effects

Mobile-first approach
The development server is now running. All sections are fully responsive and work on all screen sizes. 


I'll fix the accessibility issue in the Sheet component by adding a proper title. Here's the updated Navbar component:

Fix Sheet accessibility by adding title

components/Navbar.tsx
The changes include:

Added SheetHeader and SheetTitle components
Added a proper title "Navigation Menu" to the Sheet component
Improved the accessibility of the mobile navigation menu
The development server is already running and will automatically reflect these changes.

================================================================================

I'll break down the codebase and explain each component's role and purpose:

Root Layout and Configuration
app/layout.tsx: The root layout component that:

Sets up the base HTML structure
Configures the font (Inter)
Implements theme provider for dark/light mode
Sets metadata for SEO
app/page.tsx: Main page component that:

Assembles all major sections
Handles the overall page structure
Imports and arranges components in order
Theme Management
components/ThemeProvider.tsx:
Wraps the application with theme context
Enables dark/light mode switching
Handles system theme preferences
Navigation Components
components/Navbar.tsx:
Fixed position header
Responsive design with mobile menu
Logo display
Navigation links
Theme toggle button
Mobile hamburger menu using Sheet component
Main Content Sections
components/Hero.tsx:

Landing section
Main headline
Value proposition
Call-to-action button
components/Benefits.tsx:

Grid layout of benefits
Responsive design
Hover effects
Key features presentation
components/Solution.tsx:

Product visualization
Large image display
Description of solution
Centered layout
Contact Section
components/ContactForm.tsx:
Form validation using Zod
Form handling with react-hook-form
Input fields for user data
Submission handling
Error messages
Responsive design
Footer Component
components/Footer.tsx:
Company information
Navigation links
Contact details
Social media links
Grid layout for responsive design
UI Components
The project uses shadcn/ui components (not shown in the files but imported):

Button
Form components
Sheet (for mobile menu)
Input fields
Various other UI elements
Styling
Uses Tailwind CSS for:
Responsive design
Dark/light mode
Custom colors
Layout
Spacing
Typography
Key Features:

Fully responsive design
Dark/light mode support
Form validation
Accessible components
SEO optimization
Modern UI components
Modular architecture
Type safety with TypeScript
The architecture follows best practices:

Component-based structure
Separation of concerns
Reusable components
Client/server component separation
Type safety
Accessibility standards
Modern React patterns
Each component is designed to be:

Self-contained
Reusable
Maintainable
Accessible
Performance-optimized
The development server is running and will automatically reflect any changes made to these files.


=============================================

The ui folder contains reusable UI components from the shadcn/ui library, which is a collection of re-usable components built using Radix UI primitives and styled with Tailwind CSS. These components are essential building blocks that provide:

Accessibility: Pre-built with ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation
Customization: Easily themeable using Tailwind CSS
Type Safety: Full TypeScript support
Consistency: Unified design system
Key components in the ui folder and their purposes:

Basic Input Components
button.tsx: Reusable button styles and variants
input.tsx: Text input fields
textarea.tsx: Multiline text input
label.tsx: Accessible form labels
Navigation Components
navigation-menu.tsx: Dropdown navigation
menubar.tsx: Horizontal menu bars
breadcrumb.tsx: Navigation breadcrumbs
Dialog Components
dialog.tsx: Modal dialogs
sheet.tsx: Slide-out panels (used in mobile menu)
alert-dialog.tsx: Confirmation dialogs
Form Components
form.tsx: Form validation and handling
select.tsx: Dropdown selections
checkbox.tsx: Checkboxes
radio-group.tsx: Radio button groups
Feedback Components
toast.tsx: Notification messages
progress.tsx: Progress indicators
alert.tsx: Alert messages
Layout Components
card.tsx: Container components
separator.tsx: Visual dividers
aspect-ratio.tsx: Image containers
Data Display
table.tsx: Data tables
tabs.tsx: Tabbed interfaces
accordion.tsx: Collapsible sections
In our project, we're using these components like this:


// Example from ContactForm.tsx
import { Button } from "./ui/button";
import { Input } from "./ui/input";
import { Form, FormControl, FormField } from "./ui/form";

// Example from Navbar.tsx
import { Sheet, SheetContent } from "./ui/sheet";
Benefits of using these components:

Consistency: Ensures UI consistency across the application
Development Speed: Pre-built components save development time
Maintenance: Centralized styling and behavior
Accessibility: Built-in accessibility features
Dark Mode: Automatic dark mode support
Responsive: Mobile-friendly by default
These components form the foundation of our UI system, allowing us to build complex interfaces while maintaining consistency and accessibility.

===============================

Let me explain what would happen if you delete each component/file:

ThemeProvider.tsx
The entire dark/light mode functionality would break
Theme switching button would stop working
The site would be stuck in the default theme
Theme persistence between page reloads would stop working
Navbar.tsx
The entire navigation header would disappear
Logo would be gone
Menu items (Home, Product, Contact Us) would be missing
Theme toggle button would disappear
Mobile hamburger menu would be gone
Loss of responsive navigation
Hero.tsx
The main landing section would disappear
"Driving AI-Powered Energy Efficiency" headline would be gone
Main description text would be missing
"Learn More" button would disappear
Benefits.tsx
The benefits grid section would be removed
Six key benefit cards would disappear
Loss of the value proposition section
Solution.tsx
The solution section with the AI model image would be gone
Description of HVAC system enhancement would disappear
Large infographic image would be missing
ContactForm.tsx
The entire contact form would be removed
Form validation would be lost
Users wouldn't be able to submit their information
Loss of data collection capability
Footer.tsx
Bottom section of the website would disappear
About Us information would be gone
Navigation links would be missing
Contact information would be removed
Social media links would disappear
layout.tsx
The entire page structure would break
Theme provider wrapper would be gone
Font settings would be lost
Page metadata (title, description) would be missing
page.tsx
The main page composition would break
Component organization would be lost
The entire page would be empty as this file orchestrates all components
Deleting any of these components would significantly impact the website's functionality and user experience. Each component plays a crucial role in the overall application structure and removing them would break specific features or entire sections of the website.
